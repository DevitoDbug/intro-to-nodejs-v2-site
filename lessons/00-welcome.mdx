 software engineer and CEO of [Tipe](https://tipe.io). Welcome to my courses on production grade Next.js! Have you built one or two apps with Next.js, maybe a weekend project, evaluating rather Next.js has the chops to be your next framework on work? (See what I did there? 😏). Then this course is for you. Previous Next.js knowledge is recommended as we'll be breezing through the basics. Checkout [my other course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/next-js/) on hot to get started with Next.js
 
 Some things we'll be covering in this course include:
 * 😱 using Next.js with a CMS
 * 👀 using database queries in our pages
 * 🔥 authentication 
 * 🎉 creating API routes
 * 💰 previewing content
 * 💸 previewing your entire app
 * ☁️deployment
 * ... SO.MUCH.MORE
 
Shoutout to [Frontendmasters](https://frontendmasters.com) for giving me the platform to produce these courses. It's truly an amazing service for any developer looking to skill up on something fast.


## Course
We'll be taking an MVP app and making it ready for production. Our app is called "Known", a notion / wiki app rip off. Right now its lacking some key features to make it pop and some neccessary ones so we don't lose our jobs 😱.

We'll go in and add these features and make the adjustments needed so 20m+ plus users can start using our app. Along, the way, you'll learn what it takes to ship a production grade Next.js app.
